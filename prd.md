Project Idea: Real-Time Team Collaboration App (Chat + Task Management)

A Slack-lite app where teams can:

Chat in real-time (WebSockets/Socket.io).

Assign tasks and track them (stored in PostgreSQL/MongoDB).

Get SMS notifications when assigned tasks (Twilio).

Authenticate securely (OAuth 2.0 or JWT).

Enjoy fast performance with Redis caching recent messages and tasks.

ðŸ”§ How Each Tech Fits

Backend (Go) â†’ REST + WebSocket server for messaging and task operations.

Database (PostgreSQL) â†’ Store users, teams, chats, and tasks.

Redis â†’ Cache recent messages, session tokens, and task activity feeds.

Authentication (OAuth 2.0/JWT) â†’ Users log in with Google/GitHub or via email/password with JWT.

SSL/TLS â†’ All comms encrypted.

WebSockets + Socket.io â†’ Real-time chat, task updates, and notifications.

Twilio API â†’ Send SMS reminders for upcoming deadlines or missed messages.

CI/CD pipeline â†’ Automated testing + deployment to cloud ( GitHub Actions + Docker).


Performance & Scalability

Redis ensures quick lookups for last messages/tasks.

PostgreSQL/MongoDB handles long-term persistence.

Go backend is lightweight and performant.

Can easily scale horizontally by sharding teams into multiple servers.
